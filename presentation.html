<h1>Git Presentation</h1>


<h2>Terminal</h2>
<section id="terminal">

<p>There are two ways to start a repository. One is to clone an existing repo.
The other is to go to a directory and type git init.</p>

<kbd id="git-init">git init</kbd> <samp id="git-init-output">Initialized empty
Git repository in /Users/Ally/www/out-house/.git/</samp>

<p>As you can see, that creates a directory called .git in the root of your project. If you've
worked with Subversion, you may know that it puts .svn files in every directory it knows about. 
One nice thing about Git is it only puts that directory in the root.</p>

<p>Let's get to work and create a file so we can add it to our repo.</p>

<ins id="edit-create-house-css">(create a file called house.css)</ins>

<p>Now if we check the status...</p>

<kbd id="git-status">git status</kbd>

<samp># On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	house.css
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</samp>

<p>We can see that git recognizes a file has been added to the directory, but 
it's not going to do anything with that file until we put it in the staging area.</p>


<kbd>git add house.css</kbd>

<samp></samp>

<p>After adding the file, we can commit, which will add it to the repository. When you
commit, you must supply a message stating what's been changed.</p>

<kbd>git commit -m "First commit. The house has walls."</kbd>
<samp>[master (root-commit) 71f2aac] First commit. The house has walls.
 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 house.css
</samp>

<p>That's a good start. Now let's add a roof to the house...</p>

<ins>(write code for the roof)</ins>

<p>And check the status...</p>

<kbd>git status</kbd>

<samp># On branch master
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   house.css</samp>

<p>Now git is tracking the file, but the changes we just made haven't been staged yet.</p>

<kbd>git add house.css</kbd>

<p>Now that the changes have been added to the staging area, we can commit.</p>

<kbd>git commit -m "Added a roof"</kbd>

<samp>[master 71f2aacb] Added a roof
 1 files changed, 22 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</samp>

	
<p>Let's do some more edits and commit again.</p>	
	
<ins>(create door.css, edit house.css to @import door.css)</ins>

<kbd>git commit -a -m "Added a door"</kbd>

<samp>[master a0663e2] Added a door
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 door.css</samp>

<p>But wait! We didn't add the changes to the staging area. The <code>-a</code> adds any 
changes that are outstanding before committing, saving a step. Technically, in this case,
we should have added door.css first, because <code>-a</code> doesn't include files that
git doesn't know about. (Log it as a defect, and we'll fix it in a fast-follower. ;-))</p> 

<p>We can use git log to see a summary of the changes that have been committed to this point.</p>

<kbd>git log</kbd>

    First commit. The house has walls.
</samp>

<p>One thing that's helped me understand how git (and other DVCSs) works is to think of each
commit pointing to its predecessor. <em>Git can't tell you where you're going, but it can 
tell you where it's been.</em></p>

<p>Now let's talk about branching. When you create a new repository, a default branch, called
master, is created.</p>

<p>We can fork off a new branch. The syntax is kind of weird but it doesn't take long to
memorize.</p>


<kbd>git checkout -b my-branch</kbd>

<samp>Switched to a new branch 'my-branch'</samp>

<p>Now let's add some more features. I'm going to skip over the editing from this point and
get right to the committing.</p>

<kbd>git commit -a -m "Added a window"</kbd>

<samp>[my-branch 298bd17] Added a window
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</samp>

<p>That door could use a splash of paint. Let's change that.</p>

<kbd>git commit -a</kbd>

<p>Wait, what about the commit message? If you don't specify one in the command line, 
git will open up your favorite editor and let you type it in there. It also provides
some instructions and details about what changed, which is nice.</p>

<ins><h3>(opens your favorite editor)</h3>
	
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch my-branch
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	modified:   house.css
#</ins>

<p>Type a commit message, save and close to continue.</p>

<samp>[my-branch d6c3476] A splash of paint on the door.
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</samp>

<p>Let's do one more commit on this branch.</p>

<kbd>git commit -a -m "I've always wanted a real fireplace."</kbd>
<samp>[my-branch 07b14dd] I've always wanted a real fireplace.
 2 files changed, 7 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</samp>

<p>Now let's go back to the master branch.</p>

<kbd>git checkout master</kbd>
<samp>Switched to branch 'master'</samp>

<p>And we'll commit a couple of changes on master. In the real world, this is quite a common
workflow. You start a branch, go add some features, and then go back to master.</p>

<kbd>git commit -a -m "Added siding"</kbd>
<samp>[master 4c93a6a] Added siding
 2 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)</samp>

<kbd>git commit -a -m "On second thought, let's make it brick"</kbd>
<samp>[master 147c7c2] On second thought, let's make it brick
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</samp>

<p>Except, unless you're doing a quick bug fix, you're probably not going to make changes on
master while you still have a branch hanging out there. More likely you'll be pulling in changes
that others have pushed since you checkout out the branch.</p>

<p>If we check the log at this point, we'll only see the changes that were made on master, and 
none of the changes that were made while we were on the other branch.</p>

<kbd>git log</kbd>

commit 0f5420eb6cc6a7f5ee75ef0aedcd6f4825ed1223
Author: Patrick McElhaney &lt;patrick.mcelhaney@ally.com&gt;
Date:   Thu Mar 10 16:18:52 2011 -0500

    Added a roof</samp>

<p>Now let's pull it all together: the new changes on master, and the changes that were made on
the branch.</p>

<p>First, we'll check out the branch again. It's a good practice to get everything working on a
branch, and then ship the whole thing up to master. That way master is always stable, only 
containing work that's "ready for primetime."</p>

<kbd>git checkout my-branch</kbd>
<samp>Switched to branch 'my-branch'</samp>

<p>Remember how I said each commit points to its predecessor? The first commit on this branch is based on 
the third commit on master. If we <em>rebase</em> it to point to the latest commit on master, all of the
changes on master will cascade down through the branch.</p>

<kbd>git rebase master</kbd>
<samp>First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Added a window
Applying: A splash of paint on the door.
Applying: I've always wanted a real fireplace.
</samp>

<p>Another useful metaphor is to think of it like you're cutting a movie. Luke is shown in the
garbage compactor with a piece of garbage on his head. But you decide that looks silly, so you 
rewind to point where he's first shown in the garbage compactor and insert a scene in which he 
removes the garbage. Then you re-film the rest of the sequence without the garbage hat.</p> 

<p>Sorry about the lame metaphor. Anyway, we now have a house complete with brick, fireplace,
etc. on my-branch. It looks good, so we want to send the whole thing over to master.</p>

<p>First checkout master.</p>

<kbd>git checkout master</kbd>
<samp>Switched to branch 'master'</samp>

<p>Now we can merge my-branch onto master. If you only remember one thing, let it be this:
<strong>rebase down to branches, merge up to master</strong>.

<kbd>git merge my-branch</kbd>
<samp>Fast-forward
 house.css |    2 ++
 1 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
</samp>

<p>And now that everything is on master, we can dispense with the branch.</p>

<kbd>git branch -d my-branch</kbd>
<samp>Deleted branch my-branch (was 05d9b14).</samp>

<p>And that's it! Here are some more useful commands to play around with.</p>

<kbd>git show</kbd>
<kbd>git checkout d2e31a914028ad734f957d88a92945a6b5d0c0d0</kbd>
<kbd>git checkout d2e31a</kbd>
<kbd>git checkout HEAD^ </kbd>
<kbd>git checkout HEAD~1</kbd>
<kbd>git log d2e31a..945a6b5</kbd>
<kbd>git log HEAD~20..HEAD^^</kbd>
<kbd>git log since="2 days"</kbd>
<kbd>git whatchanged d2e31a..HEAD</kbd>
<kbd>git blame</kbd>
<kbd>git blame | mate</kbd>
<kbd>git tag</kbd>
<kbd>git rebase -i</kbd>
<kbd>git stash</kbd>

<kbd>git show d2e31a</kbd>
